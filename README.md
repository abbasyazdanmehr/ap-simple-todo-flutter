# Simple ToDo

Advanced Programming excercise, very simple application written by Flutter just for introducing with some of flutter features and coding mood.

This app does not save the user data 😕. If you want to save user data you can see my other Flutter projects like my [Billing App](https://github.com/abbasyazdanmehr/billing-app-flutter) project.

## Main Features

- [X] Simple Splash Screen.
- [X] Images as backgrounds.
- [X] Working with ModalBottomSheet in good way.
- [X] Assigning widget indices to objects (Tasks).

## Flutter Packages

No package for this app 😐.
